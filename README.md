# The HIP framework for parallel computing

The Heterogeneous Interface for Portability (HIP) provides a programming framework for harnessing the compute capabilities of multicore processors such as the AMD MI250X GPUâ€™s on Setonix. In this course we focus on the essentials of developing HIP applications, with a focus on supercomputing.

## Folder structure

* **course_material** - contains the material for the course
* **deployment** - contains tools for deploying the material to Github and managing users
* **resources** - helpful tools and information for use wi the course

## Syllabus

In this course we cover the following topics. Each topic is a folder in **course_material**

* Lesson 1 - Introduction to HIP and high level features
* Lesson 2 - How to build and run applications on Cray AMD systems like Frontier and Setonix
* Lesson 3 - A complete example of matrix multiplication, explained line by line
* Lesson 4 - Debugging HIP applications
* Lesson 5 - Measuring the performance of HIP applications with profiling and tracing tools
* Lesson 6 - Memory management
* Lesson 7 - Strategies for optimising HIP kernels
* Lesson 8 - Strategies for optimising IO in HIP applications
* Lesson 9 - Porting CUDA applications to HIP

## Format

Each lesson is in the form of Jupyter notebooks which can be viewed on the student's machine with JupyterLab or with a web browser. All exercises may be performed on the command line using an SSH connection to a remote server that has ROCM installed.

## Installation


### Anaconda Python (optional)

A recent version of [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) is helpful for viewing the notebook files. A list of helpful packages for viewing the material may then be installed with this command when run from the **HIP_Course** folder. 

```bash
pip -r deployment/requirements.txt
```

then run 

```bash
jupyter-lab
```

from the command line to start the Jupyter Lab environment.

### ROCM

In order to use the material in this course a full installation of [ROCM](https://docs.amd.com/) is advised. It is the path of least pain to use a distribution of Linux that ROCM officially supports. The AMD utility **amdgpu-install** can install ROCM packages. This command will install the ROCM tools.

```bash
sudo amdgpu-install -y --usecase=opencl,hip,rocm,openclsdk,hip,hiplibsdk,rocmdevtools,rocmdev
```

### AMD backend

It is advisable to use an AMD graphics card that ROCM supports. Other AMD GPU's work unofficially, but you can expect undefined behaviour.

### NVIDIA backend

HIP can also use a CUDA backend. In that case install both ROCM and CUDA. Then the course may be run on a CUDA backend with a recent NVIDIA graphics card. In such instances the environment variable **HIP_PLATFORM** must be set to nvidia.

### CPU backend

If either and AMD or NVIDIA backend is not available then the [HIP CPU runtime](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP-CPU) is a header-only library that provides a way to develop HIP applications on a CPU.
