# The HIP framework for parallel computing

The Heterogeneous Interface for Portability (HIP) provides a programming framework for harnessing the compute capabilities of multicore processors such as the AMD MI250X GPUâ€™s on Setonix. In this course we focus on the essentials of developing HIP applications, with a focus on supercomputing.

## Folder structure

* **course_material** - contains the material for the course
* **deployment** - contains tools for deploying the material to Github and managing users
* **resources** - helpful tools and information for use wi the course

## Syllabus

In this course we cover the following topics. Each topic is a folder in **course_material**

* Lesson 1 - Introduction to HIP and high level features
* Lesson 2 - How to build and run applications on Cray AMD systems like Frontier and Setonix
* Lesson 3 - A complete example of matrix multiplication, explained line by line
* Lesson 4 - Debugging HIP applications
* Lesson 5 - Measuring the performance of HIP applications with profiling and tracing tools
* Lesson 6 - Memory management
* Lesson 7 - Strategies for optimising HIP kernels
* Lesson 8 - Strategies for optimising IO in HIP applications
* Lesson 9 - Porting CUDA applications to HIP

## Format

Each lesson is in the form of Jupyter notebooks which can be viewed on the student's machine with JupyterLab or with a web browser. All exercises may be performed on the command line using an SSH connection to a remote server.

## Installation

In order to use the material in this course a full installation of ROCM is advised, on distribution of Linux that ROCM supports and and AMD graphics card that ROCM supports. Alternatively the course may be run on a CUDA backened with a recent NVIDIA graphics card. In such instances the environment variable **HIP_PLATFORM** must be set to nvidia.
