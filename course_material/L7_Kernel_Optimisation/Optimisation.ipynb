    "# Optimising HIP kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of HIP kernels is a complex **multi-dimensional optimisation problem**. It depends not only on efficient utilisation of hardware threads in compute units, but also on the timeliness and speed that memory is passed in and out of compute units. It is a general rule that vendor-specific libraries such as [rocBLAS](https://rocblas.readthedocs.io/en/rocm-5.6.1/) and [CuBLAS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas) are the **best way** to achieve optimal compute performance, however canned solutions are **not always available** for your chosen algorithm. At the same time, HIP implementations and their underlying hardware often have smart technologies built-in to optimise processing for commonly used computing operations. Sometimes the simplest approach works best! At other times better compute performance comes at a **significant increase** in the complexity of a program. When developer time is critical, a piece of code that is performant but complex to understand may not be **ideal** for progress. While HIP is mostly targeted at using GPU's, there is a [CPU implementation](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP-CPU/) available, and CPU and GPU architectures are optimsed for different ways of computing. This means that a kernel that performs well on a CPU might perform poorly on a GPU, and vice-versa. **Experimentation to see which strategy works best is the key!** In the following sections we will explore the ways in which kernel performance can be impacted and try a number of strategies to increase performance for the matrix multiplication kernel."

    "\n",
    "The model discussed above for executing instructions in lock-step over thread teams is known as SIMT (Single Instruction Multiple Threads). As with SIMD, each compute unit executes the same instruction over every hardware thread (lane) in the team. The crucial distinction between SIMD and SIMT is that each lane of a thread team has a degree of self determination. Each lane has access to its own data and the ability to execute a unique (to a thread) code path. Since lanes in a team execute in lock-step with each other, all hardware threads in the team **must** come along for the ride and participate in **every** unique code path. It is therefore good for performance to keep the number of unique paths to a **minimum**. Results from threads that are not meant to participate in a code path are **masked out**.  \n",

    "In summary, for SIMD a single vector instruction **must apply to all elements** of a vector and no path divergence is possible. SIMT allows for hardware threads to follow unique code paths, with the condition that all code paths must be visited by every hardware thread in the team, even if the their results are masked out.\n",

    "#### Occupancy\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU vendors overcome memory latency shortcomings by having **deep execution pipelines**, meaning that multiple teams (warps or wavefronts) can be active (in the process of executing instructions) on a compute unit at any one time. A block can have more than one thread team in it and a compute unit can switch focus between thread teams in blocks **with minimal overhead**, to hide latencies while memory is being fetched. Naturally one would want as many thread teams active as possible, and **Occupancy** is a term used to describe the ratio of how many teams **are active** vs how many **can be** active. Full occupancy is generally good for performance, but there are a number of limits that can impact occupancy, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* limits on blocks per compute unit\n",
    "* limits on the number of thread teams per compute unit\n",
    "* limits on threads per block\n",
    "* limits on threads per compute unit\n",
    "* limits on registers per compute unit\n",
    "* limits on registers per block\n",
    "* limits on shared memory per compute unit\n",
    "* limits on shared memory per block\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of software threads in a block is too low, then occupancy is reduced by the limit of permissible blocks per compute unit. If it is too large then you either might not be able to schedule a kernel, or synchronisation between thread teams becomes time consuming. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Registers and occupancy\n",
    "\n",
    "If each thread uses too many registers, or the block uses too much shared memory, then that can reduce performance through either limiting occupancy or spilling over into scratch (global memory) at the price of greater latency. If your kernel is large and uses **too many registers** then consider finding ways to split the computation over successive lightweight kernel calls. You can find the number of registers deployed and occupancy achieved with the hipcc compiler flags `-Rpass-analysis=kernel-resource-usage` and `--save-temps`. See [this AMD blog post on register pressure](https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd-lab-notes/amd-lab-notes-register-pressure-readme/) for more helpful tips on reducing register pressure and increasing occupancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function **hipGetDeviceProperties** can help us get a struct from which we can query both the maximum number of registers per block (in the field `regsPerBlock`) and the maximum number of threads that can be active on a Compute Unit or Streaming Multiprocessor (in the field `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor`). The ratio of these two properties is an indication of how many registers are available to a thread if full occupancy is to be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool Omniperf can also highlight how many Vector General Purpose Registers (VGPRS) and Scalar General Purpose Registers (SGPRS) are being used in a kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Launch bounds as a compiler hint\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding how many registers to allocate to a kernel, the compiler takes account the maximum number of threads that are possible per block and the number of blocks that will run per compute unit or streaming multiprocessor. On [AMD architectures](https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd-lab-notes/amd-lab-notes-register-pressure-readme/) registers are allocated assuming a maximum of 1024 threads per block may be used at launch. One can modify this assumption using the `__launch_bounds__(MAX_THREADS_PER_BLOCK, MIN_BLOCKS_PER_CU, MAX_BLOCKS_PER_CU)` kernel qualifier. An example kernel with launch bounds specified is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "#define MAX_THREADS_PER_BLOCK 256\n",
    "#define MIN_BLOCKS_PER_CU 1\n",
    "#define MAX_BLOCKS_PER_CU 8\n",
    "\n",
    "// standard matrix multiply kernel\n",
    "__global__ void __launch_bounds__(MAX_THREADS_PER_BLOCK, MIN_BLOCKS_PER_CU, MAX_BLOCKS_PER_CU) mat_mult (\n",
    "        float_type* A, \n",

    "    ///...\n",
    "} \n",
    "```\n",
    "For our kernels we plan on using up to 1024 threads per block, and during compilation we see that the number of registers used is low. Therefore we do not need to try using launch bounds to optimise performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Available work as a limit on occupancy\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes occupancy is simply limited by not having enough parallel work scheduled to keep a sufficient number of work items busy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the matrix multiplication algorithm as it stands, we are using a small number of private variables and we have one work item for every element in matrix C. For a matrix size of $1024^{2}$ there can be just over $1,048,576$ or threads (kernel invocations). We will see if this is enough work to keep the MI250X and NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU's at full occupancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Limits for the MI250X\n",
    "\n",
    "From this [source](https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd-lab-notes/amd-lab-notes-register-pressure-readme/#:~:text=This%20means%20that%20the%20physical,the%20most%20common%20occupancy%20limiters.) and from the `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor` property, the CDNA2 architecture present in the Radeon Instinct MI250x GPU may have 32 wavefronts (32x64=2048 threads) active on a compute unit at any one time. If we query **regsPerBlock** on the MI250x we see that there are a maximum of 65,536 vector registers available per block if only 1 block occupies a compute unit. This means at full occupancy each kernel must ideally consume up to **65536/2048 ~= 32** registers before occupancy will be affected. Since there are 110 compute units in MI250x GCD there can be 110x32x64 = 225,280 threads active at any one time on a MI250x.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Limits for NVIDIA compute capability 8.6\n",
    "\n",
    "From the occupancy table in [NVIDIA Nsight Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute)  and from the `maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor` property, an NVIDIA RTX 3060 with CUDA compute capability 8.6 can have 48 warps (48x32=1536 threads) active per streaming multiprocessor active at any one time. As with AMD processors there are 65,536 registers available per streaming multiprocessor (compute unit). Therefore at fully occupancy each kernel must ideally consume up to **65536/1536 ~= 42** registers before occupancy will be affected. Since there are 28 streaming multiprocessors then 28x1536 = 43,008 threads may be active at any one time. \n",
    "\n",
    "With either architecture we know there is more than enough work scheduled to keep the Compute Units / Streaming Multiprocessors busy. In the default matrix multiplication algorithm there is no shared memory usage and very little register usage, so we anticipate that the GPU can sustain full occupancy with the right block size.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tips for maximising occupancy\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips for maximising occupancy are:\n",
    "\n",

    "* Keep the number of private variables (register usage) low.

    "    * Split the computation over successive lighter-weight kernels.\n",
    "    * Avoid passing in objects to kernels if they use a lot of memory.\n",
    "    * Avoid allocating large static arrays within a kernel.\n",
    "    * Declare variables within code blocks, use these variables close to the computation.\n",
    "    * Function calls from within a kernel are inlined. Avoid too many function calls.\n",
    "    * Set the `__launch_bounds__` qualifer on kernels to set expectations for the compiler on the maximum number of threads in a block and the minimum number of active thread teams to have ready.\n",
    "    * Manually use shared memory to store extra variables if absolutely necessary.\n",
    "* Keep the shared memory usage low\n",
    "* Keep the workload consistent across workgroups\n",
    "* If possible schedule enough work so that every compute unit in the GPU can achieve full occupancy."

One needs to be careful then to avoid building kernels where individual work-items execute different (and lengthy) code paths, because then the whole team has to visit each code path. For example the following kernel code is not ideal because work-items with even-numbered worker_id's execute work package 1 while the odd-numbered workers are masked out, then the odd-numbered threads in the team execute work package 2 while the even threads are masked out.

    "### Floating point operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Math operations (such as multiply or add) on floating point numbers are an essential component of scientific applications. These operations are typically performed on 32- or 64-bit numbers, however 16-bit operations are becoming popular in machine learning as those do not require extremely precise calculations. Performance of a processor is measured in FLOPS, or the total number of floating point operations its compute units can perform in one second. At the time of writing units of gigaFLOPS ($10^{9}$), teraFLOPS ($10^{12}$), petaFLOPS ($10^{15}$), and exaFLOPS ($10^{18}$) are commonly used to describe compute device performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw floating point performance of a compute device is very much dependent on precision and wether or not the architecture is built for it. Gaming hardware is often optimised for 32-bit floats, and 64-bit processing may be emulated in software or accomplished with fewer cores. For example the RTX 3060 graphics card has a 64-bit floating point processing rate that is **64 times lower** than 32-bit due to having 64 times fewer 64-bit capable processing elements. CPU's have SIMD processing units that can process vectors of floats with a single instruction. At the time of writing vectors of up to 512 bits (16 floats) can be processed in a single clock cycle by AVX-512 instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute performance within a kernel is also determined by the type of math instruction performed. Addition, multiplication, and fused multiply-add are among the **cheapest** operations to perform (costing a few processor cycles), whereas division, square-root, and trigonometric functions are typically an **order of magnitude** more expensive. Writing your kernels to minimise expensive math operations will help, however waiting for memory is time consuming, and during those times kernel math can often be done for free."

It helps us gauge if an algorithm is likely to be constrained by bandwidth or floating point performance. For our problem matrix A is of size ($N_{0,C}, N_{1,A}$) and B is of size ($N_{1,A}, N_{1,C}$). Every element of matrix C requires $N_{1,A}$ loads from A, $N_{1,A}$ loads from B, and 1 store to C.

    "### Tiled memory access\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use shared memory effectively for large arrays we need to reduce shared memory usage. One strategy is to divide up the N1_A axis (dimension 1 of **A**, and dimension 0 of **B**) into tiles of size **chunk_len** and iterate over them to accumulate the dot product. This keeps shared memory size small because only enough shared memory for one tile needs to be stored for reuse over all tiles. Then we have the option of reading tiles into shared memory from either **A**, **B** or both. A fixed tile length is also good for performance because we can make it a multiple of elements in a cache line, and enlarge N1_A (pad A and B with zeros) to make sure there is always an integer number of tiles along the N1_A axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each thread in a block iterates over all the tiles and accumulates the result of the dot product. If the block size is **(blockDim.x, blockDim.y)=(L1, L0)** then the allocations of shared memory memory for **A** and **B** are defined to be of size **(blockDim.y, chunk_len)** and **(blockDim.x, chunk_len)** respectively. Each completed tile (along row **i0** of **A** and row **i1** of **B** represents a partial dot product along the N1_A axis, and the accumulated dot product is placed into **C** at position (i0, i1).\n",
