    "# Porting CUDA programs to HIP\n",
    "\n",
    "HIP API calls are designed to closely match their CUDA equivalents. This enables HIP to function as a thin layer over CUDA and allows for reasonably easy porting of CUDA code to HIP code. Often it is just a matter of replacing **cuda -> hip** in the function calls. The ROCM library provides two different tools **hipify-perl** and **hipify-clang** to help with the porting process. The tool **hipify-perl** uses perl to perform an intelligent search and replace of cuda calls with hip calls, while the **hipify-clang** tool uses the clang preprocessor to produce a high quality port. The perl-based method is better for quick ports of small codes, while the clang-based method is intended for ports of large codebases, but needs access to all the header files used in the compilation of the CUDA code."

    "\n",
    "From [this source](https://sep5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Programming_Guides/HIP-porting-guide.html) it is recommended to attempt porting on a machine that has access to both CUDA and HIP libraries. This usually means doing the port on a machine with an NVIDIA GPU. Then one can try porting portions of the code at a time and compare results. For best results with hipify-clang you need to have a version of CUDA that is compatible with your installed version of hipify-clang. "
